# Arduino Fire Alarm
A simple fire alarm using arduino. My first try on Arduino and Embedded Systems. \

## What does it do?
This fire alarm system is a simple yet effective homemade alarm system. The system can detect fire using a flame sensor and makes a high piched noise when fire is detected. The system also has the functionality of adjusting the sensor's sensitivity using a potentiometer. The value of the sensor sensitivity is displayed on a 7 Digit display.
